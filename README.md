# Historical context for this project:

I created this IOS upgrade script back in 2017.  My Python training, at the time, was a "Python for the Absolute Beginner"
book and a follow-on course.  The course mostly rehashed the book, but it also taught me about libraries, import statements, 
and StackOverflow.  In other words, I was very green.

I had a friend at Cisco, who was a CS major, and he got tasked to create an IOS upgrade automation.  The problem was,
he had zero network engineering background and was running into dead ends.  So, he asked me for assistance and I created 
this solution over the next few weeks.

The coding doesn't follow best practices, it's hard to read and hard to follow.  However, it was sufficient to get the 
job done for the next 1.5 years and it reduced the time and complexity of Cisco IOS upgrades by 60-70%.  I also was 
selected to work with the DNAC BU for a feature that later became DNAC SWIM (Software Image Mgmt).  

All thanks to this early project.
