# Historical context for this project:

I created this IOS upgrade script back in 2017 while working at Cisco.  My Python training, at the time, was a "Python for the Absolute Beginner" book and a follow-on course.  I needed to pull this together because I had a friend who was a CS major and he was tasked to create an IOS upgrade automation.  The problem was, he had zero network engineering background and was running into dead ends which was not going over well with mgmt.  So, he asked me for assistance and I coded this solution over the next few weeks.

My coding style has evolved quite a bit since then, but this was sufficient to get the job done for the next 1.5 years and it reduced the time and complexity of Cisco IOS upgrades by 60-70%.  I also was selected to work with the DNAC BU to co-develop a feature that later became DNAC SWIM (Software Image Mgmt).  All thanks to this early project.

## Note about Sanitization:
This is a sanitized version of my original project.  Unfortunately, due to sanitization, the project no longer functions as expected.
